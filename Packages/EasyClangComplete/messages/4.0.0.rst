Version 4.0.0
=============

New features:
-------------
- **BREAKING CHANGE**:
  - New setting        : "errors_style".
  - Deprecated setting : "errors_on_save"
- The new setting "error_style" allows for a choice between popups and
  phantoms to show the compilation errors. See settings for more info.
- Support for Objective C and Objective C++ (only tested on OSX)
- Seems that the plugin is fast enough, so we have added " " (space) as a
  trigger for completion.
- Doxygen comment parsing has gotten slightly better.

Thanks!
