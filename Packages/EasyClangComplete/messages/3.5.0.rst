Version 3.5.0
=============

Bug fixes and improvements
--------------------------
- fix bug in clang 4.0 python bindings so you can use it now 🍾🎉🎉🎉🍾.
- progress indicator is now neater and smaller and will not be shown for the
  files that this plugin does not run on.
- introduced an optional new setting: ``libclang_path``.
  - you don't need this if everything is working for you already.
  - otherwise, if you know where your libclang library lies, you can set it.
