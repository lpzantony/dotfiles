Version 4.0.2
=============

Fixes and improvements:
-------------
- better parsing of ``compilation_database.json``
- now also databases generated with Bear are supported.
- tooltips now also show information about macro declaration.
- better parsing of Doxygen comments for tooltips. Now also works without an
  explicit brief tag.

Thanks!
