Version 4.0.3
=============

Fixes and improvements:
-------------
- the settings are loaded lazily now, which guarantees that they always will
  be valid in case they get invalidated or not fully loaded (e.g. while the
  plugin is loading for the first time).
- clean install of the plugin and updates should work properly without
  restarting sublime text now.
- disabling/enabling the plugin should not crash it anymore.
- on some systems, libclang reported the file name as encoded string which
  resulted in unnecessary re-parsing of the translation unit. This is fixed
  now.
