Version 3.5.2
=============

New setting!
------------
- ``use_libclang_caching`` - now you can decide if you want to use libclang
  caching. Using cache is a lot faster, but can produce wrong completions in
  rare cases. See issue #228 on GitHub for discussions.
- Thanks @simia for a pull request on this! 👍

Restart
-------
Please restart Sublime Text if something does not work after the update.
